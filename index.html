<!--	Explanation: This approach to creating the Mayden Academy logo is based around the use of triangles. The ability
		to create an arbitrary triangle in CSS means that it is possible to create an arbitrary shape not containing
		curved lines from only triangles. The mayden academy logo has two curved lines - one is the circular border
		surrounding it and the other is a small curved section at the top of the "A"
		As such, I have recreated the logo using only these two circles and trianges. Furthermore, none of the triangles
		overlap (though rounding errors mean that there will be some very small overlaps) -->



	<div class="canvas">
		
		<!-- background to go behind letter "A" mask -->
		<!-- background is made from 5 triangles. One for each of the central, left and right colours and two to 
			 create a rectangle for the bottom colour section -->
		<div class="background">
			<div class="center"></div>
			<div class="leftContainer">
			<!-- This container is for the area of green to the left of the "A" and needs two triangles due to
				 the curved area at the top of the "A". I am allowing myself to overlap with the curved segment
				 as approximating that well would take too many triangles to be worthwhile -->

				 Most of the triangles in this document are doubled up. This is because rounding
				 errors cause tiny borders to appear between the triangles, and showing each
				 triangle twice seems to make these smaller -->
